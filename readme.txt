== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I use this plugin with other translations =

Create a PO file for the localization desired, name it with the appropriate country code and language code and add it to the "languages" folder. See http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/translating-wordpress-themes-and-plugins/ or http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers#PO_files for more info. If you provide an additional translation, please send it to me, and I can add it to the next version. http://mike-eng.com
